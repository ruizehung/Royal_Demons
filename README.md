## Background Story:
*The Royal Kingdom once lived in harmony with the wild’s various types of creatures. Aimed for the goal of living peacefully with nature’s wildlife, the Royal Kingdom set out to bring humans and creatures together in one environment. After a century-long established kingdom of peace and prosperity, a demonized man soon realized another perspective to view these creatures, to carry out his own greedy desires. Using dark magic to possess these creatures and slowly take over the kingdom, the evil man kidnaps creatures one by one to his dungeon and uses them against the Royal Kingdom. It didn’t take long for Demon Man to acquire his new army of once-happily-living possessed creatures. After having just captured his best friend, Dino Baby journeys out in vengeance to retrieve his GF and restore balance to his kingdom.*
